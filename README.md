# Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm

Weight of (i,j)= i+j if |i-j| <= 3, and i and j are not the same. All other weights are infinity. All edges are generated with this restriction. 

### GUI
Number of nodes, the source (S) and destination (D) nodes are input the program. The program shows every step of the shortest step.
